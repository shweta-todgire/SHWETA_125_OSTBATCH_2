Development Model:
Imagine a group of software developers who want to create a new operating system. They decide to follow the GNU development model. In this model, developers work together to create software that anyone can use, study, modify, and distribute. It’s like a big collaborative project where everyone can contribute.

Licensing:
To make sure their software stays open and free, the developers choose the GNU General Public License (GPL). This license ensures that anyone who uses or modifies their software must also share their changes under the same terms. It’s like a “pay it forward” rule for software.

Mode of Funding:
For funding, they rely on donations, grants, and volunteer contributions. They don’t sell their software for profit. Instead, they depend on the support of individuals, organizations, and communities who believe in their mission of creating free and open-source software.

1.	Commercial Use: You can use GNU-licensed software for commercial purposes, meaning you can use it in your business, sell products or services based on it, and make money from it. However, if you modify and distribute the software to customers, you must also provide them with the same freedoms to use, modify, and distribute your modified version under the same GNU license terms.
	2.	Non-Commercial Use: You can also use GNU-licensed software for non-commercial purposes, such as personal projects or academic work. The key difference here is that you don’t have an obligation to share your modifications with others if you don’t distribute the software to anyone else. You can still modify it for your own use without any specific requirements.
