Development Model:
Imagine a group of programmers working together to create a new operating system. They want to encourage collaboration from others, so they choose the BSD development model. This means they make their source code open to anyone who wants to see it or contribute to it. It’s like inviting people to help build a house and giving them the blueprint.

Licensing:
Now, let’s talk about the license itself. The BSD license they use is like a set of rules for how people can use their code. It’s quite permissive. It says, “You can use our code in your own projects, even for commercial purposes, as long as you follow a few simple rules.” These rules include giving credit to the original developers and not holding them legally responsible if anything goes wrong.

Mode of Funding:
The group of programmers behind this operating system needs money to keep things going. They decide to rely on donations and sponsorships from individuals, companies, and organizations who appreciate their work. It’s a bit like having a tip jar for their project, and people or businesses can contribute if they like what they see.

Commercial Use:

	•	Businesses often like the BSD license because it’s very business-friendly. They can use the recipe to create products, like software, and sell them without sharing their secrets.
	•	Companies might use BSD-licensed software to build their own products or improve their services.

Non-Commercial Use:

	•	The BSD license is also popular among students, hobbyists, and open-source enthusiasts. They can use the recipe to create projects, just for fun or to learn.
	•	Universities and research institutions might use BSD-licensed software for various research projects.
