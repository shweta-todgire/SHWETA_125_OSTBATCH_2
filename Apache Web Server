APACHE WEB SERVER :-
#Understanding the developmental model :
Apache is considered open source software, which means the original source code is freely available for viewing and collaboration. 
Apache is just one component that is needed in a web application stack to deliver web content. 
One of the most common web application stacks involves LAMP, or Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP.
As a Web server, Apache is responsible for accepting directory (HTTP) requests from Internet users and sending them their desired information in the form of files and Web pages.
Much of the Web’s software and code is designed to work along with Apache’s features.
