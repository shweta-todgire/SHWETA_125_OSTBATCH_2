Introduction:
GitHub is like a magical library for computer code. Let’s explore how it’s built, what rules it follows, how it gets money, and how people use it.

Development Model:
•	GitHub is like a big, shared notebook where people write down their computer code. Imagine lots of students collaborating on their homework in the same notebook.
•	Just like in a group project, people can work together on code and share it with others. It’s like sharing your homework answers with classmates.

Licensing:
•	GitHub doesn’t have strict rules about what you can put in the notebook. It’s up to the people who write the code to decide how others can use it.
•	Some people say, “Anyone can use my code,” while others might say, “You can use it, but you have to give me credit.”

Mode of Funding:
•	GitHub makes money by offering special features to people who want more than just a basic notebook. It’s like a free library with optional paid memberships for extra benefits.
•	Companies and professionals might pay for these extra features because they’re really helpful for their work.

Commercial Use:

•	Companies often use GitHub to store and share their code for software projects. It’s like a workshop where they build their digital products.
•	GitHub helps businesses work more efficiently by keeping track of changes in the code and allowing multiple people to work on it at the same time.

Non-Commercial Use:

•	Many individuals and open-source projects use GitHub for free. It’s like a playground for creative ideas and learning.
•	Students, hobbyists, and nonprofit organizations also use GitHub to collaborate on coding projects, like making games or useful tools.
