Introduction:
LibreOffice is a software tool that helps people create documents, like letters and spreadsheets. Let’s explore how it’s made, what rules it follows, how it gets money, and how it’s used.

Development Model:

	•	LibreOffice is like a big project where many volunteers and experts work together. They’re like a team building a cool treehouse.
	•	They share their work with everyone. It’s like inviting all the neighborhood kids to play in the treehouse and help build it.

Licensing:

	•	LibreOffice has a special rulebook called open-source licensing. It says, “Anyone can use, change, and share LibreOffice for free.” It’s like letting anyone play with your toys without charging them.
	•	This rulebook also says that if you make changes to LibreOffice, you have to share those changes with everyone else. It’s like adding a new swing to the community playground for all to enjoy.

Mode of Funding:

	•	LibreOffice doesn’t make money in the usual way like selling things. Instead, it relies on donations from people who like using it. It’s like having a lemonade stand, and your neighbors donate to keep it running.

Commercial Use:

	•	Some companies use LibreOffice in their offices instead of paying for other software. It saves them money and helps them get work done.
	•	Businesses might also offer support and services related to LibreOffice to earn money.

Non-Commercial Use:

	•	Many individuals use LibreOffice at home, for school, or to write that novel they’ve always wanted to write. It’s like having a free, versatile tool for everyday tasks.
	•	Schools, charities, and government organizations also use LibreOffice because it’s free and reliable for their needs.
