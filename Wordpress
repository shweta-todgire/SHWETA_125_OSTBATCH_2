Casestudy of Wordpress:-
Developmental Model:
WordPress is an open-source content management system (CMS) that means it’s built and improved by a community of volunteers and developers from around the world. This community collaborates to create and enhance WordPress. Anyone can contribute by writing code, fixing bugs, or developing plugins and themes.

Licensing:
WordPress is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL), which is a free and open-source software license. This license ensures that WordPress remains free to use, modify, and distribute. It promotes the idea that software should be accessible to everyone.

Mode of Funding:
WordPress primarily relies on donations and community support for funding. The WordPress Foundation, a non-profit organization, manages these donations and supports the project’s growth. Additionally, some revenue comes from services like WordPress.com, a hosted version of WordPress with premium features.

Commercial/Non-Commercial Use:
WordPress can be used for both commercial and non-commercial purposes. Many businesses and organizations use WordPress to build their websites, blogs, and online stores. It’s also a popular choice for personal blogs and hobby websites. You can use it without paying for the software itself, but you might incur costs for hosting, themes, and plugins, especially for commercial projects.
